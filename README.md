# Hi I'm Corty,
🚧 Currently building VA Godly

VA Godly is a high-volume automation engine that helps agencies scale their acquisition workflows across multiple accounts without burning out their team.

It combines:

Human-like browser automation (no APIs, no bans)

AI-generated conversations that adapt to each target

Smart warm-ups and follow-ups that run 24/7

Cross-account orchestration with isolated profiles

Lead discovery & scoring to target the highest-intent users

The goal: replace repetitive VA tasks with a consistent, automated system that finds, warms, and converts prospects at scale.
